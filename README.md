# Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) that enables users to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, users can describe the desired state of their infrastructure in configuration files, specifying resources such as virtual machines, networks, and storage, and then Terraform automates the process of creating, updating, and managing these resources across various cloud providers and on-premises environments. This approach allows for consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments, simplifying the management of complex systems and facilitating infrastructure automation.

## Idempotence

One of the key benefits of Terraform is its support for idempotent operations. An operation is considered idempotent if the result of performing it multiple times is the same as performing it once. In the context of Terraform, this means that applying the same configuration multiple times will not result in any changes to the infrastructure if the desired state is already achieved. This property is essential for ensuring the predictability and reliability of infrastructure deployments, as it allows users to safely reapply configurations without causing unintended side effects or disruptions.

Terraform does this by maintaining a state file that tracks the current state of the infrastructure and the desired state defined in the configuration files. When applying a configuration, Terraform compares both and determines the necessary actions to bring the infrastructure into the desired state, that way accurately determining which resources need to be created, updated, or deleted to achieve the desired configuration.

## Terraform vs Ansible

While Terraform and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) are both popular tools for automating infrastructure management, they serve different purposes and are often used together in complementary ways. Terraform is primarily focused on defining and provisioning infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage, using a declarative configuration language. In contrast, Ansible is a configuration management tool that is designed to automate the installation and configuration of software on existing servers.
