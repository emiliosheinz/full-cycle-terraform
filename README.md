# Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) that enables users to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, users can describe the desired state of their infrastructure in configuration files, specifying resources such as virtual machines, networks, and storage, and then Terraform automates the process of creating, updating, and managing these resources across various cloud providers and on-premises environments. This approach allows for consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments, simplifying the management of complex systems and facilitating infrastructure automation.

## Idempotence

One of the key benefits of Terraform is its support for idempotent operations. An operation is considered idempotent if the result of performing it multiple times is the same as performing it once. In the context of Terraform, this means that applying the same configuration multiple times will not result in any changes to the infrastructure if the desired state is already achieved. This property is essential for ensuring the predictability and reliability of infrastructure deployments, as it allows users to safely reapply configurations without causing unintended side effects or disruptions.
